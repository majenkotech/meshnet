MeshNet
=======

This is a small mesh tunnelling system for Linux.  The basic idea is that it
allows multiple remote nodes to act as if they are all connected to the same
local ethernet network.  Each node maintains a list of the addresses of all
the other nodes in the network and automatically distributes the list to any
new nodes that connect.

Communication is over UDP, so this will not work for nodes behind NAT
gateways (home routers, etc). 

All communication is encrypted with AES rijndael-128.

A node, when connecting to the network, needs to know the address of
one other node to begin communication. That can be any node on the
network - there is no "master" node.
