MeshNet
=======

This is a small mesh tunnelling system for Linux.  The basic idea is that it
allows multiple remote nodes to act as if they are all connected to the same
local ethernet network.  Each node maintains a list of the addresses of all
the other nodes in the network and automatically distributes the list to any
new nodes that connect.

Communication is over UDP, so you will need to set up port forwarding on NAT
gateways (home routers, etc). 

All communication is encrypted with AES rijndael-128.

A node, when connecting to the network, needs to know the address of
one other node to begin communication. That can be any node on the
network - there is no "master" node.

Configuration is performed through a configuration file which consists
of a list of key/value pairs. The default sample file contains:

    psk         WellingtonBootsAreMadeOfRubber
    network     10.0.0.1/24
    peer        1.2.3.4,2.3.4.5
    ip          3.4.5.6
    port        3647
    announce    30
    fork        no

* psk - The pre-shared key for encryption
* network - the IP address and subnet of the virtual ethernet interface
* peer - A list of peers to connect to initially - can include :port
* ip - The outside-facing IP address of this machine
* port - The UDP port to communicate on
* announce - The number of seconds between auto-announcements
* fork - yes/no - fork into the background
